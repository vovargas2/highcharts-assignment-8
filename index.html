  <p>Data on the number of people who identify as transgender is not as common because it is self-reported.
    Population-based surveys rarely ask questions to identify transgender people, so data on each report cited is based on estimates. The transgender community in the U.S. may very well be larger than reported. More studies need to be conducted on transgender people in the United States so that the country can better serve this community.</p>

<p>Florida, California and Texas are home to one of the largest populations of transgender people in the United States.</p>

<h1>Rates of Attempted Suicide Among Transgender People in the Last Year, 2015 </h1>
<p>Queer people often fear their safety and well-being by outing themselves. A trans woman may only be out to herself. A nonbinary person may only be out to their close friends. Access to appropriate healthcare for transgender people is still quite new. High suicide attempt rates reflect the tendency for LGBTQ+ people to have higher rates of mental illness than the rest U.S. population. Seven percent (7%) of all respondents attempted suicide in the past year, nearly twelve times the rate of attempted suicide in the U.S. population (0.6%). </p>
